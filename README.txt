TO DO:
 - Fill databse. Make sure uninstal and instal the app when testing brand new additions. Only add new versions after the app has been deployed
 - the images currently change incrementally, and they dont scale at all in the chat box due to an isue with figuring out the correct ratio.
 - manage options such as number of buttons
 - adding/deleting a users own categories and images
 
 PLEASE CREATE A NEW BRANCH BEFORE STARTING YOUR OWN VERSION
